This repository is a preparation exercise for the 2 Trimester 1 DAW Intensive exam, which was set to be solved in 2014, with the objective of using static arrays in Java and getting familiar with this new language. 


## Documentation Provided

Below I leave the information provided by the teacher about the exam to be done, I also leave a link to the teacher's repository with the exercise solved by him.
